The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 79 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 22.5%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid."

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 79 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 22.6%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid."
