### Actual-Parameter-Collection-for-Machine-Learning-Operators
We aim to track the actual parameters of critical machine learning operators from state-of-the art machine learning applications for statistical parameter characteristics since parameters including tensor shapes could have a decisive impact on the performance of both operator and computing graph optimizations. The repository provides an actual parameter collection conerning core operators from typical neural networks. For the time being, we have collected actual parameters of around forty machine learning operators from more than one-thousand neural networks which have a wide coverage of the computer vision-related area. Besides, we look forward to an actual parameter collection with a full coverage of various machine learning areas.
