Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

The difference between calculated theoretical (75.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (25.7%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on optimizing occupancy."

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

See the CUDA Best Practices Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on optimizing occupancy."

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

The difference between calculated theoretical (75.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (47.8%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on optimizing occupancy."

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 375 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 56.9%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 375 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 32.0%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 375 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 21.7%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 375 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 61.6%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 375 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 38.9%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 375 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 27.8%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 375 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 27.0%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 103 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 64.0%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 103 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 35.8%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 103 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 41.4%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 103 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 20.3%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 103 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 20.5%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.

The difference between calculated theoretical (75.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (60.1%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on optimizing occupancy."

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

The difference between calculated theoretical (75.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (64.0%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on optimizing occupancy."

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

The difference between calculated theoretical (75.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (61.3%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.

Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.
