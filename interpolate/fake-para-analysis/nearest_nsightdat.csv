The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 159 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 33.3% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 31.0%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid."

Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 28.3%.

Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 23.2%.

Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 20.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.2%.
